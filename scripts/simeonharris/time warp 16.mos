# Time Warp 16

#

# This scipt jumps between HalfSpeed and NormalSpeed while staying in Overdub

# Mode. The pitch is transposed one octave so whatever you play will end up -

# kind of - musical to the already looped audio. I also have a "Time Warp 6"

# scipt that is similar but goes a bit slower - gives a different groove to the

# texture. The effect of these Time Warp scipts does also differ depending on

# which speed/rate you are in when you execute the script.
