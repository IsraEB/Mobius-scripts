# Insert Grid 1 (in Four Four)
#
# This is a "beat synced tremolo gate" that creates 32nd notes on each 16th
# note cusp for one bar. You can use it to play long melody "lead" notes that
# will also create a groovy background for the next time the loop plays back -
# but then you will already be playing the next melody lead line that will
# match the old, now percussively sliced up, line. How hard the script will
# gate your audio depends on the feedback setting. Since I run Mobius in
# "Expert Mode" I'm using the AltFeedback (not the Feedback) for that. You can
# go from just a subtle coloring or the loop to hard gating Ã  la Trance Techno.
#
# This version is for music in 4/4. I have modified versions of it that fits
# playing in other meters (5/4, 6/8, 7/8).
