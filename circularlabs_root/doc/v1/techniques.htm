<a name='Introduction'>
<h1 class=sec1>1 Introduction</h1>
</a>
<a name='Record'>
<h1 class=sec1>2 Record</h1>
</a>
<p>The <i>Record</i> function is used to record new loops of live audio.
There are several ways to start and stop a recording, in the
simplest case you press the Record button once to begin recording,
and again to stop recording.  Immediately after the second press the loop
begins playing and continues until you alter it with another function.</p>
<p>Before a loop is recorded for the first time, the loop is
in <i>reset mode</i> and you will see the word <b>Reset</b> appear
in the status display.  While a loop is recording you are in <i>record
mode</i>
and will see the word <b>Record</b> in the status display.  Unless
and advanced record ending option is used, when the recording completes
the loop will enter <i>play mode</i> and <b>Play</b> will appear in the
status display.</p>
<p>If you want to discard the loop and start over you can use
the <a href='techniques.htm#Reset'>Reset</a> function to stop the loop, release all loop memory
and return to reset mode.  From there you can use the Record function
again to record another loop.</p>
<p>If you want to discard the loop and immediately begin recording
a new one just press Record again with while the loop is playing.
The memory for the previous loop is not released until you
end the new recording, you can use the <i>Undo</i> function
to cancel the new recording and return to the original loop.  Note
that Undo only restores the previous loop if the previous loop
was not empty (in reset mode). Once a loop is reset all history of
the loop is gone, you cannot undo from reset mode.</p>
<p>Another way to reset a loop is to press and hold the Record
button.  This is referred to as a "Long Press Record" and it
behaves the same as the <a href='techniques.htm#Reset'>Reset</a> function.  Using
long press Record to reset the loop is a common technique when using
a MIDI footswitch.   Since you will almost always have a footswitch
bound to the Record function you don't need to waste a footswitch
bound to the Reset function, you can simply do a long press of
the Record footswitch to do a reset.  The loop will enter record
mode for about 1/2 second (or whatever the configured long press
interval is) then the loop will be reset.</p>
<p>Once the loop has been recorded to your satisfaction, you may
begin modifying it, or combining it with loops on other tracks.</p>
<a name='Sustain Record'>
<h2 class=sec2>2.1 Sustain Record</h2>
</a>
<p>The function <i>Sustain Record</i> is used with triggers that can
communicate both a "pressed" and "released" state.  The recording starts
when the trigger is pressed and stops when it is released.  For a
footswitch that sends MIDI notes, the recording would start when
the footswitch was pressed, continue while the footswitch was held,
and stop when the footswitch was released.   This can make it easier
to record very short loops.</p>
<p>If the Sustain Record function is bound to a trigger that does
not support press/release states, such as a MIDI program change,
it will behave the same as the Record function, requiring two presses
to start and ending the recording.</p>
<a name='Record Mode'>
<h2 class=sec2>2.2 Record Mode</h2>
</a>
<p>The preset parameter <i>Record Mode</i> can be used to change the
way the Record function behaves.   It has these values:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Toggle</b> - the default, one press to start and another to stop</li>
<li><b>Sustain</b> - forces Record to behave like Sustain Record</li>
<li><b>Safe</b> - </li>
</ul>
<p>RecordMode=Safe should be it's own option so you can use it
with both toggle and sustain recording.</p>

<a name='Overdub'>
<h1 class=sec1>3 Overdub</h1>
</a>
<p>Overdubbing is the process of adding new sound to an existing loop.
It is the most common way to modify loops after recording.  When
overdub is enabled, new sound coming into a track will be merged with
the loop that is currently playing in that track.  This will result in
a new loop containing both the original sound and the new sound.</p>
<p>Unlike many loopers, overdub in Mobius does not replace the
original loop.  Instead overdubbing creates a new "layer".  Remember
that loops are not single audio recordings, they are actually made up
of several audio recordings called layers.  Each time you modify a
loop a new layer is created.  If you don't like the results of a
modification you can return the previous layer with the <i>Undo</i>
function.</p>
<p>Overdub is controlled with the following functions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Overdub</li>
<li>Sustain Overdub</li>
<li>Overdub On</li>
<li>Overdub Off</li>
</ul>
<p>The <i>Overdub</i> function will toggle overdub on and off
each time it is used.</p>
<p>The <i>Sustain Overdub</i> function will turn overdub on when the
function button is pressed and turn it off when the button is
released.  It must be used with a <i>sustainable trigger</i>.  This is
useful if you want to create very short overdubs.  Pressing, holding,
then releasing a button is much faster than trying to press a button
twice.</p>
<p>The <i>Overdub On</i> and <i>Overdub Off</i> functions turn overdub
on and off without toggling.  They are intended for use in scripts
where you want to set the overdub state without worrying about the
current state.</p>
<p>When a loop is playing, it is actually one of the layers in the
loop that is playing.  This is called the "active layer".
The active layer is usually the last layer that was created, if
you are displaying the <a href='exploring.htm#Layer Bars'>Layer Bars</a>

in the Mobius window, the active layer will be highlighted.  While
overdub is on, a new layer is continually being created as the active
layer plays.  This new layer will contain a copy of what is in the
active layer adjusted for feedback, then merged with the sound coming
into the track adjusted by the track's input level.  When the active
layer plays to the end, the new layer with the overdub is "shifted"
and becomes the active layer.  The overdubbed layer then begins
playing and a new layer is created to record the next overdub.  This
process continues for as long as overdub is enabled.  This means that
if you never turn overdub off you may generate a lot of layers.</p>
<p>If you decide you don't like an overdub, you can use the
<i>Undo</i> function to discard the new layer and return to the
previous layer.  You can keep using <i>Undo</i> to go all the way back
in time to the very first layer, then start overdubbing again.  See
the <a href='techniques.htm#Managing Layers'>Managing Layers</a> section for more information on using
<i>Undo</i>.</p>
<a name='Ending Record with Overdub'>
<h2 class=sec2>3.1 Ending Record with Overdub</h2>
</a>
<p>A very useful technique is ending a new loop recording with
the <i>Overdub</i> function.  You start by pressing <i>Record</i> to
begin recording a new loop, then when you're ready to stop instead of
pressing <i>Record</i> again, press <i>Overdub</i>.  The new loop
is created and begins playing and you are immediately placed
in <i>Overdub</i> mode.  This is important because when you transition
seamlessly from  <i>Record</i> mode to <i>Overdub</i> mode we can avoid
a fade at the end of the loop.</p>
<p>Normally when you record a loop by pressing
<i>Record</i> twice, the left and right edges of the loop are 
automatically faded to zero.  This ensure that there will be no
abrupt changes in sample level at the loop start point.  Without these
fades you would usually hear a sharp "click" every time the loop
reached its end point and begin playing from the beginning because
the audio waveform at the end of the loop would not exactly align 
with the audio waveform at the beginning of the loop.</p>
<p>The consequence of these edge fades is that you can't create a loop
that lets a sound such as a reverb tail or a cymbal crash carry over
from the end of the loop back to the start and keep going.  Any sound
at the end of the loop will be abruptly cut off and faded to zero.</p>
<p>When you end a recording with <i>Overdub</i> the right edge fade
will not be done so the sound being recorded at the end of the loop
will seamlessly carry over to the to the beginning of the next
layer. You will hear the cymbal crash or the reverb tail cross the
loop boundary without a "fade bump".  You can now leave overdub on
indefinitely or wait just long enough for the sound to decay nicely
then press <i>Overdub</i> again to end the overdub.  This can result
in much more natural sounding loops because the end of the loop will
gradually blend with the start of the loop.</p>
<a name='Overdub Mode'>
<h2 class=sec2>3.2 Overdub Mode</h2>
</a>
<p>A loop is always in one <i>major mode</i> which is displayed in
the <a href='starting.htm#Mode'>Mode</a>
 component in the user
interface.  The default major mode is <i>Play</i>.  The loop will
always return to <i>Play</i> mode when no other modes are active.
Most major modes are temporary, they begin when you execute a <i>modal
function</i> such as <i>Record</i>, <i>Multiply</i>, or <i>Insert</i>
and then end when you execute that function again.  These are
called <i>function modes</i>.  If you are already in a function mode
and then execute a different function, the previous mode is canceled
and will not be restored.  For example if a loop is in <i>Multiply</i>
mode and you execute the <i>Insert</i> function, the <i>Multiply</i>
mode is canceled and the loop enters <i>Insert</i> mode.  Later when
you execute the <i>Insert</i> function again to end <i>Insert</i> mode
the loop will not return to the previous <i>Multiply</i> mode, it will
return to <i>Play</i> mode.</p>
<p>A loop may be in any number of <i>minor modes</i> at the same time,
these are displayed in the
<a href='starting.htm#minorModesComponent'>Minor Modes</a>

component in the user interface. Examples of minor modes include
<i>Reverse</i>, <i>Half Speed</i>, and <i>Pitch Shift</i>. Minor modes
are not canceled when you change major modes.  For example if you start
in the <i>Reverse</i> minor mode when you execute the <i>Multiply</i> 
function, the major mode will change to <i>Multiply</i> but
<i>Reverse</i> minor mode will still be active.  Later when you leave
<i>Multiply</i> mode and return to <i>Play</i> mode, <i>Reverse</i> 
will continue to be active.</p>
<p><i>Overdub</i> is unusual because it has characteristics of
both <i>major</i> and <i>minor</i> modes.  Like a major mode it will
be displayed in the <a href='starting.htm#Mode'>Mode</a>
 component in
the user interface when it is active.  But like a minor mode
<i>Overdub</i> is not canceled when the major mode changes, it is 
just temporarily suspended.  It will also be displayed in the
<a href='starting.htm#minorModesComponent'>Minor Modes</a>

component in the user interface so you can see when it has been suspended.</p>
<p>For example if you start in <i>Overdub</i> mode and execute
the <i>Multiply</i> function, the major mode will change
to <i>Multiply</i> and <i>Overdub</i> is suspended.  Later when you
leave <i>Multiply</i> mode you will return to <i>Overdub</i>
mode. <i>Overdub</i> is the only major mode that behaves this way.</p>
<a name='Noise Floor'>
<h2 class=sec2>3.3 Noise Floor</h2>
</a>
<p>You may want to leave overdub on while you listen to the loop a few
times with your instrument muted.  While you are listening the loop
without playing you usually don't want more layers to be created
just because overdub was left on.  Mobius will only generate a new
layer if the maximum signal level of the sound received by the track
exceeds a threshold.  This threshold is set with the <i>Noise Floor</i>
global parameter.</p>
<p>Most instruments generate some low-level noise when they are not
being played.  Keyboards may hiss or buzz, guitars generate lots of
handling and string noise.  If you see layers being added when you are
not playing your instrument you may need to increase the <i>Noise
Floor</i> value.  If the value is zero then there will be no noise
filter and every pass of the loop while overdub is on will generate a
new layer.  The default value is 15 which is adequate for most
instruments including guitars with quiet pickups.  If you need to
raise the noise floor, increase the value by 5 or 10 until layers are
no longer being created.  You should not have to set this value
above 1000, if you do please let us know.  Be careful not to set
the <i>Noise Floor</i> too high or else overdubs may be lost if you
are playing softly.</p>
<a name='Reduce Feedback During Overdub'>
<h2 class=sec2>3.4 Reduce Feedback During Overdub</h2>
</a>
<p>If you are overdubbing a loud audio signal you need to be careful
not to overload the loop.  Mobius does not do any compression or
limiting, if you overdub loud sounds over loud sounds you may exceed
the maximum level which will cause harsh digital clipping.  If this
happens you will need to reduce the track input level or reduce
feedback.  Reducing the input level makes the new overdubbed sound
quieter, reducing feedback makes the sound being copied from the
current loop quieter.</p>
<p>If you prefer to leave the feedback control all the way up (127)
mobius can still automatically apply a small amount of feedback
while overdub is enabled.  The amount of feedback reduction is
small, approximately 5%.  This can help reduce clipping if you
overdub several times.</p>
<p>Normally this small amount of feedback reduction is not audible
but you can turn it off with a global parameter.  Open the
<i>Global Parameters</i> window and locate the checkbox labeled
<i>Reduce Feedback During Overdub</i>, uncheck the box to turn
this feature off.</p>
<a name='Overdub Quantized'>
<h2 class=sec2>3.5 Overdub Quantized</h2>
</a>
<p>Normally the overdub functions do not obey the <i>Quantize</i>
parameter, they are executed immediately when you press the function
trigger.  This is because you are usually merging new sound into an
existing sound so controlling exactly where the "edges" of the overdub
will be is not critical.  If you start overdub a little early, just
keep your instrument muted until you are ready to add something then
mute it when you're done.</p>
<p>Quantized overdub can however be useful as an effect.  If you keep
a loud sound playing before and after the overdub, you can drop in
overdubs that a very sharp attack and decay.  To enable overdub
quantization edit the preset and check the box labeled <i>Overdub
Quantized</i>.</p>

<h1 class=sec1>14 Rate Shift</h1>
</a>
<p>The <i>rate shifting</i> feature allows you to adjust the playback
and recording rate of the loop so that both the perceived pitch and
tempo of the loop change.  This is similar to the <i>Half Speed</i>
function except that you are not limited to a single rate shift of 1
octave down.</p>
<p>Rate shifting may be controlled in several ways using these
functions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rate Up</li>
<li>Rate Down</li>
<li>Rate Next</li>
<li>Rate Previous</li>
<li>Rate Normal</li>
<li>Rate Shift</li>
</ul>
<p>The <i>Rate Up</i> and <i>Rate Down</i> functions move the rate up
or down by one semitone relative to the current rate.</p>
<p>The <i>Rate Next</i> and <i>Rate Previous</i> functions select rates
defined in the <i>Rate Sequence</i> preset parameter.  A rate sequence
is a space delimited list of numbers which represent positive or
Negative rate changes in semitone increments.  For example a rate of
"1" is one semitone above normal, a rate of "-7" is 7 semitones below
normal (or a perfect fifth lower).  The rate sequence "wraps" on the
edges so if you are on the last rate in the sequence, <i>Rate Next</i>
will move to first rate in the sequence.</p>
<p>The <i>Rate Normal</i> function returns the rate to normal, no
matter how it was shifted.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most useful function is <i>Rate Shift</i>.  This allows
you to use a keyboard controller to instantly access a large range of
rates spread over several octaves.  You normally bind a MIDI note
event to the <i>Rate Shift</i> function, this becomes the <i>rate
center note</i>.  When you press the rate center note, the rate
returns to normal.  Where it gets interesting is that the notes above
and below the center note are automatically assigned to semitone rate
shifts relative to the center note.  Notes below the center note lower
the rate, notes above raise the rate.  This allows you to "play" the
loop chromatically, similar to using a sampler.</p>
<p>Note that Mobius will attempt to bind rate shift functions in a 4
octave range on either side of the center note.  For best results, it
is recommended that the center note use a MIDI channel that is not
being used for any other functions.  If a rate shift note is already
assigned to another Mobius function, the previous function will have
priority.  To avoid these conflicts use a different channel.</p>
<p>When the rate is shifted, the playback of the loop will be affected
by the setting of the <i>Rate Shift Retrigger</i> preset parameter.
If this parameter is checked, then the loop will be retriggered
whenever the rate is shifted.  This makes it behave like a sampler.
If the parameter is not checked, the rate is simply shifted without
retriggering.</p>
<a name='pitchShift'>
<h1 class=sec1>15 Pitch Shift</h1>
</a>
<p>NOTE: Pitch Shifting is provided in release 1.24 as a "technology
preview".  There are still bugs in it and I do not consider it ready
for real use.  Still you may find it interesting to get a sense for
what will eventually be provided.</p>
<p>Pitch shifting is very similar to <a href='techniques.htm#rateShift'>Rate Shift</a> except
that the pitch is changed without changing the tempo of the loop.  In
all other respects the functions and parameters used to control pitch
shifting are identical to those for rate shifting.</p>
<p>Pitch shifting may be controlled in several ways using these
functions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pitch Up</li>
<li>Pitch Down</li>
<li>Pitch Next</li>
<li>Pitch Previous</li>
<li>Pitch Normal</li>
<li>Pitch Shift</li>
</ul>
<p>The <i>Pitch Up</i> and <i>Pitch Down</i> functions move the pitch up
or down by one semitone relative to the current pitch.</p>
<p>The <i>Pitch Next</i> and <i>Pitch Previous</i> functions select pitches
defined in the <i>Pitch Sequence</i> preset parameter.  The 
<i>Pitch Sequence</i> value has the same format as the <i>Rate Sequence</i>
value described in the <a href='techniques.htm#rateShift'>Rate Shift</a> section.</p>
<p>The <i>Pitch Normal</i> function returns the rate to normal, no
matter how it was shifted.</p>
<p>Finally <i>Pitch Shift</i> allows you to use a keyboard controller
to instantly access a large range of pitches spread over several octaves.
The Pitch Shift function is bound to a MIDI note in the same way
as the <i>Rate Shift</i> function.  See 
<a href='techniques.htm#rateShift'>Rate Shift</a> for more
information
on how the notes are selected, and the issues this can cause.</p>
<p>When the pitch is shifted, the playback of the loop will be affected
by the setting of the <i>Pitch Shift Retrigger</i> preset parameter.
If this parameter is checked, then the loop will be retriggered
whenever the pitch is shifted.  If the parameter is not checked, the pitch
is simply shifted without retriggering.</p>
<a name='switching'>
<h1 class=sec1>16 Loop Switching</h1>
</a>
<p>Tracks may contain several loops but only one loop at a time can be
selected for playing or recording.  This is called the
<i>active loop</i>.  Changing the active loop in a track
a track is called <i>loop switching</i>.  Loop switching is
a complex topic because there are many options available to control when
the switch happens and what happens to the new loop after 
it is activated.</p>
<p>Often you will want to use <i>switch quantization</i> to control
when the loop switch will happen relative to the loop that is
currently playing.  This is important if you want to maintain a steady
rhythm, for example letting the current loop play to the end before
switching.</p>
<p>If the next loop is empty you will often want to automatically
begin recording into it, or copy portions of the current loop into it
so you can begin creating variations.</p>
<p>One of the most common uses for loop switching is to record
"song parts" such as verse A in loop 1, verse B in loop 2, and
a chorus in loop 3, then switch between those at rhythmically
precise times.</p>
<p>You can also use track loops as a primitive sample player where
each loop contains a different sound that when triggered plays
from beginning to end and then stops.</p>
<p>The following functions will do some form of loop switch.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Next Loop</b></li>
<li><b>Previous Loop</b></li>
<li><b>Sustain Next Loop</b></li>
<li><b>Sustain Previous Loop</b></li>
<li><b>Loop 1</b></li>
<li><b>Loop 2</b></li>
<li><b>Loop 3</b></li>
<li><b>Loop 4</b></li>
<li><b>Loop 5</b></li>
<li><b>Loop 6</b></li>
<li><b>Loop 7</b></li>
<li><b>Loop 8</b></li>
<li><b>Retrigger</b></li>
<li><b>Retrigger Once</b></li>
</ul>
<p>The <i>Next Loop</i> function will activate the next loop in the
track.  If the last loop is currently active, <i>Next Loop</i> will
wrap back around and activate the first loop.  The <i>Previous
Loop</i> function works in the opposite direction, activating the
previous loop.  If the first loop is currently active <i>Previous
Loop</i> wraps and activates the last loop.</p>
<p>The <i>Sustain Next Loop</i> and <i>Sustain Previous Loop</i>
functions must be bound to a
<a href='starting.htm#Sustainable Trigger'>sustainable trigger</a>
.  
If they are not, they behave the same as <i>Next Loop</i> and 
<i>Previous Loop</i>.  The sustain functions will switch to the new
loop while the function button is held down, then they return to the
original loop when the function button is released.  Note that
you can get sustain behavior with other loop switching functions
by setting the <a href='techniques.htm#Switch Duration'>Switch Duration</a> parameter.</p>
<p>The <i>Retrigger</i> function starts the current loop over from the
beginning.  It may not sound like this would be a loop switch but it
behaves like a switch away from and then immediately back to the
current loop.  The <i>RetriggerOnce</i> function restarts the current
loop, lets it play to the end and then automatically
enters <i>Mute</i> mode.</p>
<p>The numbered <i>Loop</i> functions switch directly to the numbered
loop.  If that loop is already selected these functions behave the
same as <i>Retrigger</i>.</p>
<a name='Switch Quantize'>
<h2 class=sec2>16.1 Switch Quantize</h2>
</a>
<p>If you want to maintain a steady rhythm as you switch between loops
you will usually want to use some form of <i>switch quantization</i>
to make the switch happen at an exact time.  Switch quantization is
not controlled by the <i>Quantize</i> parameter like most functions.
Instead there is a dedicated parameter named <i>Switch Quantize</i>
that is used for all loop switch functions.  This parameter may
have the following values.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Off</b></li>
<li><b>Subcycle</b></li>
<li><b>Cycle</b></li>
<li><b>Loop</b></li>
<li><b>Confirm</b></li>
<li><b>Confirm Subcycle</b></li>
<li><b>Confirm Cycle</b></li>
<li><b>Confirm Loop</b></li>
</ul>
<p>When the value is <i>Off</i> the switch will happen immediately
when you press the function button.</p>
<p>When the value is <i>Subcycle</i>, <i>Cycle</i> or <i>Loop</i> the
switch will be delayed until the next quantization point.  You will
see a white event marker under the loop meter showing when the switch
will happen and the loop will enter <i>Switch</i> mode.</p>
<p>When one of the four <i>Confirm</i> values is selected, an extra
confirmation action will be required before the loop switch will
happen.  After you use any of the loop switch functions, the current
loop will first enter <i>Confirm</i> mode and wait there indefinitely.
You must then execute the <i>Confirm</i> function to confirm the
switch.  See the <a href='techniques.htm#Switch Confirmation'>Switch Confirmation</a> section for other
confirmation options.  What happens after the confirmation action
depends on which <i>Switch Quantize</i> parameter value was selected.
If the value was <i>Confirm</i> the switch will happen immediately.  If the
value was <i>Confirm Subcycle</i>, <i>Confirm Cycle</i>, or 
<i>Confirm Loop</i> the loop enters <i>Switch</i> mode and waits
for the next quantization point before switching.</p>
<p>Note that while you in either <i>Confirm</i> or <i>Switch</i> 
mode many functions will behave differently than they normally do.
This is sometimes referred to as the "switch quantization period" 
and by some older EDP users as "lame duck period".  This is described
in detail later in the <a href='techniques.htm#Switch and Confirm Modes'>Switch and Confirm Modes</a> section.</p>
<a name='Switch Confirmation'>
<h2 class=sec2>16.2 Switch Confirmation</h2>
</a>
<p>If you have <a href='techniques.htm#Switch Quantize'>Switch Quantize</a> set to any of values
beginning with the word "Confirm" you must execute another function to
cancel the confirmation mode and proceed with the loop switch.  The
default function for canceling confirmation mode is <i>Confirm</i>.
This function has no other use besides switch confirmation.  If you
try to execute it when the loop is not in <i>Confirm</i> mode it
will have no effect.</p>
<p>You may not want to assign one of the precious buttons on your foot
controller to the <i>Confirm</i> function since it is normally
useless.  It is possible to select other functions that will behave as
a switch confirmation action by setting the global parameter <i>Switch
Confirmation Functions</i>.  In the <i>Global Parameters</i> window,
select the <i>Functions</i> tab and locate the item selector
labeled <i>Switch Confirmation Functions</i>.  Select the functions
you want to use for confirmation and move them to the right.</p>
<p>If you are familiar with the EDP, you may want to use
the <i>Undo</i> function for confirmation since that is the only way
to do switch confirmation on the EDP.  We here at the labs don't like
using <i>Undo</i> for confirmation because it makes it impossible to
cancel the loop switch or remove "stacked" functions.  We recommend
one of the following functions that are often assigned to a footswitch
button but are not often used during the 
<a href='techniques.htm#Switch and Confirm Modes'>switch quantization period</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Realign</li>
<li>Redo</li>
<li>Replace</li>
<li>Reset</li>
<li>Retrigger</li>
<li>Reverse</li>
<li>Speed</li>
<li>Substitute</li>
</ul>
<p>If is recommended that you do not select one of the following
functions since these have special behavior during the switch
quantization period.  If you do not need the special behavior you can
use them as confirmation functions but review the <a href='techniques.htm#Switch and Confirm Modes'>Switch and
Confirm Modes</a> section to make sure you will not need them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Record</li>
<li>Overdub</li>
<li>Multiply</li>
<li>Insert</li>
</ul>
<a name='Switch and Confirm Modes'>
<h2 class=sec2>16.3 Switch and Confirm Modes</h2>
</a>
<p>While a loop is in <i>Confirm</i> or <i>Switch</i> modes many
functions will behave differently than they normally do.  This is
sometimes referred to as the "switch quantization period" or by some
older uses as the "lame duck period".</p>
<p>Most functions you execute will simply be delayed until after the
switch.  This is called <i>function stacking</i>.  In the user
interface, you will see the function names stacking under the loop
switch event marker.  This can be used to queue up interesting
combinations of functions and have them all execute exactly at the
same time after the switch.  For example, putting the next loop
into <i>Reverse</i>, <i>Half Speed</i>, and
<i>Substitute</i> modes all at once.</p>
<p>Until the switch occurs you can use <i>Undo</i> to remove 
stacked functions if you trigger the wrong one or decide you don't 
want it.  Once you have removed all the stacked functions and you are
left with only the switch event marker, using <i>Undo</i> will cancel
the switch and leave you in the current loop.</p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> The EDP uses <i>Undo</i> as the switch confirmation
action.  If you like this and have <i>Undo</i> set in the
<i>Switch Confirmation Functions</i> global parameter, then you will not
be able to use <i>Undo</i> to undo the stacked functions and cancel
the switch when you are in <i>Confirm</i> mode.  You can however
use <i>Undo</i> normally while in <i>Switch</i> mode.</p>
<p>A few functions have special behavior when executed during the
switch quantization period.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Record</b> - forces the next loop to be rerecorded, even if it is not empty</li>
<li><b>Overdub</b> - performs a <a href='techniques.htm#Sound Copy'>Sound Copy</a> if the next loop is empty</li>
<li><b>Multiply</b> - performs a <a href='techniques.htm#Sound Copy'>Sound Copy</a> if the next loop is empty</li>
<li><b>Insert</b> - performs a <a href='techniques.htm#Time Copy'>Time Copy</a> if the next loop is empty</li>
</ul>
<p>A <a href='techniques.htm#Sound Copy'>Sound Copy</a> creates an instant copy of the original
loop in the next loop.  A <a href='techniques.htm#Time Copy'>Time Copy</a> creates a <i>clear</i>
loop of the same size as the original loop, but does not copy over any
of the audio content.  Both of these concepts are described in more
detail later.</p>
<p>The difference between <i>Overdub</i> and <i>Multiply</i> is what
mode the loop will be left on after the sound copy.  When
<i>Overdub</i> was stacked, the loop will always be left in <i>Overdub</i> 
mode if a sound copy occurred.  If <i>Multiply</i> was stacked the loop will
be left in the mode specified by the <i>Sound Copy Mode</i> preset parameter.</p>
<a name='Empty Loop Action'>
<h2 class=sec2>16.4 Empty Loop Action</h2>
</a>
<p>If you switch to a loop that is empty, the <i>Empty Loop Action</i>
parameter will be used to determine what happens after the switch.  
The possible values for <i>Empty Loop Action</i> are:</p>
<ul>
<li>None</li>
<li>Record</li>
<li>Copy</li>
<li>Copy Timing</li>
</ul>
<p>When set to <i>None</i>,  no automatic action will be performed.
The loop will be left in <i>Reset</i> mode.</p>
<p>When set to <i>Record</i>, the loop will immediately
enter <i>Record</i> mode after the switch. You can record as long as
you like but you must remember to execute the <i>Record</i> function
to end the recording.</p>
<p>When set to <i>Copy</i> a <a href='techniques.htm#Sound Copy'>Sound Copy</a> will be made
from the original loop into the new loop.</p>
<p>When set to <i>Copy Timing</i> a <a href='techniques.htm#Time Copy'>Time Copy</a> will be made
from the original loop into the new loop.</p>
<p><i>Copy Timing</i> and less often <i>Copy Sound</i> are very useful
because they let you creating synchronized loops that are exactly the
same size or an exact multiple of a common factor.  See the
<a href='synchronization.htm#Loop Sync'>Loop Sync</a>
 section
of the <i>Mobius Synchronization</i> manual for more information
on creating synchronized loops.</p>
<a name='Time Copy'>
<h3 class=sec3>16.4.1 Time Copy</h3>
</a>
<p>When <i>Empty Loop Action</i> is set to <i>Copy Timing</i> and you
switch to an empty loop, a new <i>clear</i> loop will be instantly
created that is exactly the same size as the previous loop.  This is
called a <i>Time Copy</i>.  Review the 
<a href='starting.htm#Reset, Empty, Clear, and Silent'>Reset, Empty, Clear, and Silent</a>

section of the <i>Getting Started</i> manual if you are not sure about
the difference between "empty" and "clear".  A <i>clear</i> loop has a
size and it can be played and modified, it just starts out with no
audio content.</p>
<p>In addition to copying the size, time copy will also copy the
number of cycles.</p>
<a name='Time Copy Mode'>
<h4 class=sec4>16.4.1.1 Time Copy Mode</h4>
</a>
<p>When you first switch to a time copied loop, you will be placed in a mode
defined by the <i>Time Copy Mode</i> preset parameter.  The possible
values are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Play</b></li>
<li><b>Overdub</b></li>
<li><b>Multiply</b></li>
<li><b>Insert</b></li>
</ul>
<p>The default value is <i>Insert</i>.</p>
<p>When <i>Time Copy Mode</i> is set to <i>Play</i> the copied loop
will simply start playing.  When set to any of the other values, it
behaves as if that function were automatically executed immediately
after the copy. You must then remember to execute that function again
to cancel that mode.  For example, when <i>Time Copy Mode</i> is set
to <i>Insert</i> you will immediately begin inserting into copied
loop.  You must press the button for the <i>Insert</i> function when
you are finished.</p>
<p>The values available here are the same as those available
for <a href='techniques.htm#Sound Copy Mode'>Sound Copy Mode</a>.  This means you can select <i>Multiply</i>
but this is less useful after a time copy because there is no audio
content to repeat so <i>Multiply</i> behaves almost the same
as <i>Insert</i>.  The main reason to use <i>Multiply</i> here is if
the source loop had several cycles and you wanted to immediately use
"remultiply" to remove some of the cycles from the end.
See <a href='techniques.htm#shortening'>Shortening The Loop</a> for more information on using
the <i>Multiply</i> function to make the loop smaller.</p>
<a name='Sound Copy'>
<h3 class=sec3>16.4.2 Sound Copy</h3>
</a>
<p>When <i>Empty Loop Action</i> is set to <i>Copy</i> and you switch
to an empty loop, the current loop will be instantly copied to the
next loop.  This is called a <i>Sound Copy</i>.  From the listener's
perspective, they won't know the copy happened, they will still be
hearing the original loop.</p>
<p>You may now begin changing the copied loop using <i>Overdub</i>,
<i>Multiply</i> or any other function.  When you are finished
modifying the copied loop you can use the same technique to create
another loop, or you may switch back to the original loop.</p>
<a name='Sound Copy Mode'>
<h4 class=sec4>16.4.2.1 Sound Copy Mode</h4>
</a>
<p>When you first switch to a copied loop, you will be placed in a
mode defined by the <i>Sound Copy Mode</i> preset parameter.  The
possible values are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Play</b></li>
<li><b>Overdub</b></li>
<li><b>Multiply</b></li>
<li><b>Insert</b></li>
</ul>
<p>The default value is <i>Multiply</i>.</p>
<p>When <i>Sound Copy Mode</i> is set to <i>Play</i> the copied loop
will simply start playing.  When set to any of the other values, it
behaves as if that function were automatically executed immediately
after the copy. You must then remember to execute that function again
to cancel that mode.  For example, when <i>Sound Copy Mode</i> is set
to <i>Multiply</i> you will immediately begin multiplying the copied
loop.  You must press the button for the <i>Multiply</i> function when
you are finished multiplying.</p>
<p>Some people find it convenient to assign the <i>Play</i> function
to a button.  <i>Play</i> is like a universal mode canceling function,
if you are in any recording mode (<i>Record</i>, <i>Multiply</i>,
<i>Insert</i> etc.) pressing <i>Play</i> will cancel that mode and return
you to <i>Play</i> mode.  So after you have performed a loop copy you don't
need to think about <i>Sound Copy Mode</i> and execute the corresponding
function to end the mode, just use <i>Play</i> and it will cancel whatever
mode you are in.</p>
<a name='Switch Location'>
<h2 class=sec2>16.5 Switch Location</h2>
</a>
<p>The <i>Switch Location</i> parameter determines where the playback
position will be after you switch to another loop.  The possible values
are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Follow</b> - keep the same location you had in the previous loop</li>
<li><b>Restore</b> - restore the location the new loop had the last time it was playing</li>
<li><b>Start</b> - start the new loop from the beginning</li>
<li><b>Random</b> - move to a randomly chosen subcycle</li>
</ul>
<p>When using <i>Follow</i>, if the new loop is smaller than the
current loop the playback position may need to be "wrapped" so that it 
fits within the new loop.  For example if the current loop is 6 seconds
long and you are currently at the start of second 5, then you switch
to a loop that is 3 seconds long, the new loop location will be at
the start of second 2.</p>
<p>When using <i>Restore</i>, if the new loop has never been played the
location will be at the start.  If you are using one of the methods
to perform a sound copy or a timing copy (see <a href='techniques.htm#Empty Loop Action'>Empty Loop Action</a>) then
the location will not be restored.</p>
<p><i>Switch Location</i> only applies if the loop is not empty (in
Reset mode).  If the loop is empty then the new location will always
be at frame zero of the empty loop.</p>
<a name='Switch Duration'>
<h2 class=sec2>16.6 Switch Duration</h2>
</a>
<p>The <i>Switch Duration</i> parameter determines how long you will
stay in the new loop after a switch.  This parameter is used by all
switch functions except <i>Sustain Next Loop</i>, <i>Sustain Previous Loop</i>,
<i>Retrigger</i>, and <i>Retrigger Once</i>.    The possible values are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Permanent</b> - stay in the new loop until it is manually changed</li>
<li><b>Once</b> - play the new loop until the end, then automatically enter <i>Mute</i> mode</li>
<li><b>Once Return</b> - play the new loop until the end, then automatically return to the previous loop</li>
<li><b>Sustain</b> - play the new loop for as long as the function button is held down, then it automatically enter <i>Mute</i> mode</li>
<li><b>Sustain Return</b> - play the new loop for as long as the function button is held down, then return to the previous loop</li>
</ul>
<p>The most common option is <i>Permanent</i>, you remain in the new
loop until you change it with another loop switch function.</p>
<p>The <i>Once</i> option when combined with a <a href='techniques.htm#Switch Location'>Switch
Location</a> value of <i>Start</i> makes the loop triggering
functions behave similar to a sampler.  The loop always starts playing
from the beginning, plays once, then stops (enters mute mode).</p>
<p>The <i>Sustain</i> option must be used with a switch function
bound to a 
<a href='starting.htm#Sustainable Trigger'>sustainable trigger</a>
. 
If you use a non-sustainable trigger then this will behave the same
as <i>Permanent</i>, you will remain in the new loop but it will not
enter <i>Mute</i> mode automatically.</p>
<p>The <i>Sustain Return</i> option must also be used with a switch function
bound to a 
<a href='starting.htm#Sustainable Trigger'>sustainable trigger</a>
. 
If you use a non-sustainable trigger then this will behave the same
as <i>Permanent</i>.</p>
<p>Note that when <i>Switch Duration</i> is set to <i>Sustain
Return</i> the <i>Next Loop</i> function behaves the same as
the <i>Sustain Next Loop</i> function.  <i>Sustain Next Loop</i>,
and <i>Sustain Previous Loop</i> will always return to the original
loop when the sustain ends.  They ignore the <i>Switch Duration</i>
parameter.</p>
<p>The <i>Retrigger</i> and <i>Retrigger Once</i> functions ignore
the <i>Switch Duration</i> parameter.  <i>Retrigger</i> always behaves
as if <i>Switch Duration</i> was set to <i>Permanent</i> and
<i>Retrigger Once</i> always behaves as if <i>Switch Duration</i>
was set to <i>Once</i>.</p>
<a name='Return Location'>
<h2 class=sec2>16.7 Return Location</h2>
</a>
<p>If you switch to a loop with the <a href='techniques.htm#Switch Duration'>Switch Duration</a>
parameter set to <i>Once Return</i> or <i>Sustain Return</i> you will
eventually be automatically returned to the original loop unless you
cancel the return.  The <i>Return Location</i> parameter determines
where you will begin playing in the original loop.  The possible
values are the same as the values for the <a href='techniques.htm#Switch Location'>Switch Location</a>
parameter.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Follow</b> - keep the same location you have in the current loop</li>
<li><b>Restore</b> - restore the location the original loop had the last time it was playing</li>
<li><b>Start</b> - start the original loop from the beginning</li>
<li><b>Random</b> - move to a randomly chosen subcycle</li>
</ul>
<p>When using <i>Follow</i>, if the original loop is smaller than the
current loop the playback position may need to be "wrapped" so that it
fits within the new loop.  For example if the current loop is 6
seconds long and you are currently at the start of second 5, then you
return to a loop that is 3 seconds long, the new loop location will be
at the start of second 2.</p>

<p>When you execute any of the loop switch functions, you can choose
to have some of the current loop modes carried over to the next loop.
This is controlled with a set of "transfer mode" preset parameters
found under the <i>Loop Switch</i> tab.</p>
<a name='Record Transfer'>
<h3 class=sec3>16.8.1 Record Transfer</h3>
</a>
<p>The <i>Record Transfer</i> parameter determines whether
the <i>Record</i> major mode will be carried over from the current
loop to the next loop.  It has these possible values.</p>
<ul>
<li>Off - Record is not transferred</li>
<li>Follow - Record is transferred</li>
</ul>
<p>When this parameter is set to <i>Follow</i>, if the current loop is
in <i>Record</i> mode, after the switch the next loop will also
automatically enter <i>Record</i> mode.  Note that this will happen
whether or not the next loop is empty.  This option is useful if you
want to record a set of loops all at once without stopping.  Start
by executing the <i>Record</i> function to record the first loop.
Then execute the <i>Next Loop</i> function to end the current recoding
and immediately begin recording the next loop.</p>
<p>When this parameter is set to <i>Off</i> and the current 
loop is in <i>Record</i> mode, executing a switch function will finish
the recording of the current loop then switch to the next loop.
If the next loop is not empty it will simply start playing.  If the next
loop is empty the <a href='techniques.htm#Empty Loop Action'>Empty Loop Action</a> parameter controls
what will happen.</p>
<a name='Overdub Transfer'>
<h3 class=sec3>16.8.2 Overdub Transfer</h3>
</a>
<p>The <i>Overdub Transfer</i> parameter determines whether
the <i>Overdub</i> minor mode will be carried over from the current
loop to the next loop.  It has these possible values.</p>
<ul>
<li>Off - Overdub will be forced off in the next loop</li>
<li>Follow - Overdub will be carried over from the current loop to the next loop</li>
<li>Restore - Overdub will be restored to the state it had the last time the next loop was active</li>
</ul>
<p>The default value is <i>Off</i>.  If you like to leave overdub
mode on all the time and control overdubbing by muting your instrument
you may want to set this to <i>Follow</i> so you don't have to 
reactivate overdub every time you switch loops.</p>
<p>Setting this to <i>Restore</i> is relatively unusual because you
usually care more about what the overdub state is now, not what it
was in the past.</p>
<a name='Reverse Transfer'>
<h3 class=sec3>16.8.3 Reverse Transfer</h3>
</a>
<p>The <i>Reverse Transfer</i> parameter determines whether
the <i>Reverse</i> minor will be carried over from the current
loop to the next loop.  It has these possible values.</p>
<ul>
<li>Off - Reverse will be forced off in the next loop</li>
<li>Follow - Reverse will be carried over from the current loop to the next loop</li>
<li>Restore - Reverse will be restored to the state it had the last time the next loop was active</li>
</ul>
<p>The default value is <i>Off</i>.  If you think of reverse
as a "global" option that should apply to all loops in a track then
set this parameter to <i>Follow</i>.</p>
<p>Setting this to <i>Restore</i> may be interesting if you want to have
some loops that always play forward and some that always play 
in reverse.</p>
<a name='Rate Transfer'>
<h3 class=sec3>16.8.4 Rate Transfer</h3>
</a>
<p>The <i>Rate Transfer</i> parameter determines whether the <i>Rate
Shift</i> minor mode will be carried over from the current loop to the
next loop.  This applies to shift applied by the various <i>Rate</i>
functions as well as the <i>Half Speed</i> function.
It has these possible values.</p>
<ul>
<li>Off - Rate shift will be off in the next loop</li>
<li>Follow - Rate shift will be carried over from the current loop to the next loop</li>
<li>Restore - Rate shift will be restored to the state it had the last time the next loop was active</li>
</ul>
<p>The default value is <i>Off</i>.  If you think of rate shift
as a "global" option that should apply to all loops in a track then
set this parameter to <i>Follow</i>.</p>
<p>Setting this to <i>Restore</i> may be interesting if you want to have
loops that always play at different rates.</p>
<a name='Pitch Transfer'>
<h3 class=sec3>16.8.5 Pitch Transfer</h3>
</a>
<p>The <i>Pitch Transfer</i> parameter determines whether the <i>Pitch
Shift</i> minor mode will be carried over from the current loop to the
next loop.  It has these possible values.</p>
<ul>
<li>Off - Pitch shift will be off in the next loop</li>
<li>Follow - Pitch shift will be carried over from the current loop to the next loop</li>
<li>Restore - Pitch shift will be restored to the state it had the last time the next loop was active</li>
</ul>
<p>The default value is <i>Off</i>.  If you think of pitch shift as a
"global" option that should apply to all loops in a track then set
this parameter to <i>Follow</i>.</p>
<p>Setting this to <i>Restore</i> may be interesting if you want to
have loops that always play with different amounts of pitch shift.</p>
<a name='Switch Velocity Sensitive'>
<h2 class=sec2>16.9 Switch Velocity Sensitive</h2>
</a>
<p>The <i>Switch Velocity Sensitive</i> parameter can be used to
automatically adjust the track output level during a loop switch.
This can only be used if the loop switch function is bound to a
MIDI <i>Note</i> message that can carry velocity information.  When
this parameter is checked, the output level of the track will be set
to the velocity value of the MIDI note that triggered the loop switch
function.  If a loop switch function is not bound to a MIDI <i>Note</i>
message, then this parameter will be ignored.</p>
<p>This is most often used with the 8 numbered <i>Loop X</i> functions
bound to adjacent keys on a MIDI keyboard, or to velocity sensitive
pads on a control surface.  Once loops have been recorded you can then
"play" the loops by triggering them from the MIDI device making them
softer of louder depending on how hard you hit the key/pad.  If you
also set the <a href='techniques.htm#Switch Location'>Switch Location</a> parameter to <i>Start</i> and the
<a href='techniques.htm#Switch Duration'>Switch Duration</a> to <i>Once</i> it will behave like a
simple velocity sensitive sample player.</p>
<a name='Retrigger and Retrigger Once'>
<h2 class=sec2>16.10 Retrigger and Retrigger Once</h2>
</a>
<p>The <i>Retrigger</i> and <i>Retrigger Once</i> functions are
considered to be loop switch functions but they are unusual because
they do not change the loop.  They always restart the current loop
from the beginning and stay in the current loop.</p>
<p>They will obey the <a href='techniques.htm#Switch Quantize'>Switch Quantize</a> parameter so that you
can stack functions to be executed after the retrigger.  But they
ignore the <a href='techniques.htm#Switch Location'>Switch Location</a> and <a href='techniques.htm#Switch Duration'>Switch Duration</a>
parameters.</p>
<p>Since the loop does not change all of the 
<a href='techniques.htm#Switch State Transfer'>Switch State Transfer</a> parameters are also ignored.</p>

<a name='Bounce Recording'>
<h1 class=sec1>21 Bounce Recording</h1>
</a>
<p>The <i>Bounce</i> function allows you to capture the
output of several tracks, mix them together, and copy the result into
an empty track.  This is similar to the <i>bounce down</i> mixing
technique used with a multi track recorder.</p>
<p>When the Bounce Record function is first called, it begins
capturing the output of any track that is currently playing.  The
track output is mixed together "post fader" so the Output Level
control of each track may be used to control the track mix
in the recording.</p>
<p>When Bounce Record is called a second time, the captured and mixed
track output is copied to the first empty track (from the left).  The
source tracks are then immediately muted, and the new track immediately
begins playing.  This new track contains a single loop with the
captured output from the other tracks.  This loop can then be
manipulated as usual.</p>
<p>Any number of bounce recordings can be made, but you must have at
least one empty track.  If there are no empty tracks when the
second Bounce Record is called, the recording is thrown away.</p>
<p>Note that bounce recording is a special kind of "global mode" that
is not related to any particular track or loop.  While you are bounce
recording, you can be manipulating tracks and loops in any way,
including recording new loops, multiplying, overdubbing, triggering,
and rate shifting.  Mobius is recording the entire process.</p>
<p>Bounce recording can be especially useful with the Retrigger, Rate
Shift and Pitch Shift functions.  Once a loop is created, you can
play a chord progression using Rate Shift or Pitch Shift, record the
result of that performance, and bounce this into a new track to serve
as a background loop.</p>
<p>The timing of the bounce recording may be controlled with the
<i>Bounce Quantize</i> parameter.  Bounce quantization is not affected
by the <i>Quantize</i> parameter that is used with other functions.
This is because bounce quantization is almost always set to <i>Loop</i>
or <i>Cycle</i>, but you may not wish to use this same quantization
for the functions that build the loop.</p>
